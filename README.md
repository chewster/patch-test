This is my Patch.com coding assessment 

## Project Requirements
To create a mashup of 2 (or more!) data sources and present the results in an appropriate UI.  If possible, the data sources should be endpoints you can hit with an ajax call (as opposed to hard-coding in raw data).  The data sources, the presentation, and underlying language & framework/libraries used are all your choice.  This is a chance to be creative and also show off your skills.

## Endpoints Used 

#### `http://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q='+ searchWord +'&from=' + todaysDate +'&sortBy=publishedAt&apiKey=f9b70e839a1b47e2a8b11a8ad054ec62`
