This is my Patch.com coding assessment 

## Project Requirements
To create a mashup of 2 (or more!) data sources and present the results in an appropriate UI.  If possible, the data sources should be endpoints you can hit with an ajax call (as opposed to hard-coding in raw data).  The data sources, the presentation, and underlying language & framework/libraries used are all your choice.  This is a chance to be creative and also show off your skills.

## Run locally

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm install`

install the necessary node modules for this project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
